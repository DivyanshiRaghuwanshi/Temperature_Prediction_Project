# Temperature_Prediction_Project
# Objective:
This project predicts temperature based on humidity data using machine learning models. It uses a Linear Regression and a Decision Tree Regressor and comparison between the performances of both the models to evaluate performance.

# What's Included:
Dataset with humidity and temperature readings

Data preprocessing and visualization

Training using Linear Regression and Decision Tree

Model comparison using MSE, MAE, RMSE, RÂ² score and plots

Visualization of predicted vs actual temperature
